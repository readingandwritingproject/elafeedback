Dear Colleagues,
<br /><br />
I couldn't be more proud of the professionalism, dedication and intelligence that shines through the postings on this site. Your commitment to the highest standards for literacy instruction is crystal clear. Before I developed this site, people cautioned me that it would be filled with mindless ranting against the CCSS and against all testing, but you are proving those predictions to be absolutely wrong. Your detailed, thoughtful responses to the test, your descriptions of your kids' experiences with the tests, your insights about what the tests might mean for literacy education in the future, are all incredibly helpful. And your dedication to high standards, and attentiveness to your students is beautiful.
<br /><br />
I know that people who can make a difference are reading your responses. I know of journalists who are reading this, researchers from not-for-profits, literacy scholars, policy leaders from NYS, people who lead county-wide PTAs.  I assume people at Pearson have found their way onto this site as well. I wonder what they are thinking, and I await the day when they respond to you all. Did they neglect to pilot a high stakes test such as this one?  How else can one explain the issues around time? You'll see lots of the links that address some of the issues around Pearson. And you need to know that this is a time in the history of high stakes testing when big decisions are being made, decisions that will shape the future of our field. Will States continue to endorse the Common Core? Will Pearson become one of the major providers of high stakes CCSS testing, or will that be left to the not-for-profit companies that do not also make curriculum. Will New York State go with PARCC or with Pearson, especially when we've always been told that PARCC's tests will require a technological capacity that we don't come close to having (in Election Day in NYC, when all the teachers get onto computers, the traffic is more than our system can bear and things inevitably crash--imagine if all the kids instead of all the teachers were on!) My point is that there could not be a more important time for this conversation.
<br /><br />
<!-- This weekend, a teacher--Stacy Fell-Eisencraft--is going to try to bring some structure to this site. She'll develop some categories, and highlight themes. Next week I am talking to leaders from New York State. I know many of you are already talking to parents, and I know some of your students are using their newly polished skills at argument writing to do some real-world, high stakes writing-to-make-a-difference. -->If any of you have suggestions for the site or for the effort to improve testing and learning in our State (and presumably the nation,) please speak up. I know some of your students are already using their newly polished skills at argument writing to do some real-world, high stakes writing-to-make-a-difference.
<br /><br />
Meanwhile, what will you do to celebrate that the testing is over? Who was it who said, on this site, that she took her daughter to a book store for some REAL books. Bravo!!! Let's help kids remember that one reads to acquire knowledge, to walk in the shoes of another person, to live vicariously, to learn, learn, learn.

Colleagues,
<p>
We have launched a site (<a href="http://elafeedback.com">http://elafeedback.com</a>) on which teachers, principals and parents can converse about observations and insights from having experienced the new ELA firsthand. This year's test is a window onto what test-makers and policy makers propose for an entire new generation of tests. And those tests (which are still open to major revision) will change the face of curriculum, of schools, of childhood, of reading and of writing. Although some people are probably making you think that you can't talk about the test, the truth is that the people closest to youngsters and most knowledgeable about schooling--you and others like you--must talk about the test. It is easy to do so in ways that don't violate any test-security concerns (don't cite specific test items or passages).
<p>
You are the "researcher" with the most crucial data in hand, and your insights are critical. Details and concrete specifics will help. How long did it take kids to read the directions? Which sections seemed to especially set kids off? What could have helped? What do you think will happen to the teaching of reading if this test sets the pattern for test in the future to come? How will you suggest alter instruction based on what you saw? Will that improve teaching and learning? What are your overall thoughts?
<p>
The insights and information here will be shared with test makers and policy leaders. We will monitor the site so that we delete any inadvertent detail writes that isn't considered ok by the state. We'll be adding tech improvements to the site soon.
<p>
You need not include your name (and we understand some of you feel that you cannot).  But I encourage you to sign your name as anonymous entries are far less trusted than those written by someone who is willing to 'stand and be counted.' We encourage you to share this with one and all.
<p>
Thanks for your engagement on behalf of kids.
