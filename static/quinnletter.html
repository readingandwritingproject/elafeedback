Dear Commissioner King:
<p>
I rarely write letters or e-mails to public officials nor do I complain about most changes that have taken place in the Department of
Education. I have proudly served the City of New York and the Department of Education for over 25 years. However, the last three days of ELA testing have caused me to contact you to express my concern about
these NYS assessments. I have never experienced the level of stress, anxiety and tears on the part of the students (and parents) as I have done these past three days. 
<p>
On the Day 1 portion of the assessment, I looked over the passages and realized that some of the questions were not testing reading comprehension, but rather, were assessing our students' working
memory. As I looked over a fifth grade test, I tried to find the answer to one of the questions. It required me to flip back and forth between pages to read several paragraphs to determine the theme of the passage. By the time I reread the passages, I completely forgot what the question was asking. With all the flipping back and forth and booklets falling off the desks, I can't imagine how my students will perform on this
section.
<p>
I had to console so many students who were sobbing that I feel this ELA assessment borders on child abuse. This was especially so for Day 2 of the exam. Although the students had 90 minutes to complete the two booklets, many of them did not get to finish their work. They were heartbroken! They told me that they had worked so hard to prepare for these exams. Yet, they were rushed and couldn't use the strategies we had taught them. When we write, we plan, draft, revise and edit. Many of the students never even completed their draft! Even our strong writers could not go back and review their work. These advanced writers couldn't complete these tasks on time! Imagine the anxiety and stress on our special education students!
<p>
We have now survived the last three days of ELA testing. I am thankful that this torture is over (for now). Unfortunately, we have to gear up for math next week. All I can think about is what this experience has done to my hardworking and caring students. I have had numerous calls from parents who were hysterical when they heard about the tests from their children. I have no problem with more rigorous assessments. What
<p>
I have a problem with is the inhumane treatment of my children.  It is time that the field of education be returned to the educators who understand how children develop and learn. I am asking for rigor with a conscience and an understanding of the young child.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
Dolores Troy-Quinn<br />
Principal<br />
The Castlewood School-PS 186Q
